# NFT Project Overview

This project introduces an enhanced feature called `borrowAuthNFT` to the existing NFT contract, allowing public access to retrieve metadata associated with our NFTs.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Flow Playground
- Basic understanding of Cadence Language

## How to Use

To interact with the NFT project on the Flow Playground, follow these steps:

1. Develop your contracts, transactions, and script files directly within the Flow Playground environment.
2. Initiate the `CreateCollection` transaction to establish the NFT collection.
3. Mint a new NFT by executing the `MintNFT` transaction.
4. Use the `GetID` script to obtain the NFT ID for incorporation into the main script.
5. Execute the `MetaData` script to extract data from the created NFT.

This setup empowers users to seamlessly engage with the NFT project, leveraging the newly introduced `borrowAuthNFT` feature for convenient access to public metadata.
